title: Zero-Shot Clinical Acronym Expansion via Latent Meaning Cells
abstract: We introduce Latent Meaning Cells, a deep latent variable model which learns
  contextualized representations of words by combining local lexical context and metadata.
  Metadata can refer to granular context, such as section type, or to more global
  context, such as unique document ids. Reliance on metadata for contextualized representation
  learning is apropos in the clinical domain where text is semi-structured and expresses
  high variation in topics. We evaluate the LMC model on the task of zero-shot clinical
  acronym expansion across three datasets. The LMC significantly outperforms a diverse
  set of baselines at a fraction of the pre-training cost and learns clinically coherent
  representations. We demonstrate that not only is metadata itself very helpful for
  the task, but that the LMC inference algorithm provides an additional large benefit.
