title: Quantifying Common Support between Multiple Treatment Groups Using a Contrastive-VAE
abstract: Estimating the effect of a given medical treatment on individual patients
  involves evaluating how clinical outcomes are affected by the treatment in question.
  Robust estimates of the treatment effect for a given patient with a prespecified
  set of clinical characteristics, are possible to obtain when there is sufficient
  common support for these features. Essentially, features having the greatest common
  support correspond to regions of significant overlap between the distributions of
  the different treatment groups. In observational datasets, however, all possible
  treatment options may not be uniformly represented, and therefore robust estimation
  of their effect may only be possible for the patients in the overlapping region.
  In this work, we propose a Contrastive Variational Autoencoder (ContrastiveVAE)
  to estimate where there is significant overlap between patient distributions corresponding
  to different treatment options. A Contrastive-VAE exploits shared information between
  different groups by modeling the shared information as arising from a shared set
  of latent variables to approximate distributions for treatment options that are
  not well represented in observational datasets. The result is an improved estimation
  of the distribution of the groups with a small number of data points. By estimating
  the likelihood for each group with annealed importance sampling, we are able to
  quantitatively identify the area of overlap between multiple treatment groups and
  obtain an effective confidence interval for the estimated individual treatment effect.
