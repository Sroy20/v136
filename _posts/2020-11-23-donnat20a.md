title: A Bayesian Hierarchical Network for Combining Heterogeneous Data Sources in
  Medical Diagnoses
abstract: 'The increasingly widespread use of affordable, yet often less reliable
  medical data and diagnostic tools poses a new challenge for the field of ComputerAided
  Diagnosis: how can we combine multiple sources of information with varying levels
  of precision and uncertainty to provide an informative diagnosis estimate with confidence
  bounds? Motivated by a concrete application in lateral flow antibody testing, we
  devise a Stochastic Expectation-Maximization algorithm that allows the principled
  integration of heterogeneous and potentially unreliable data types. Our Bayesian
  formalism is essential in (a) flexibly combining these heterogeneous data sources
  and their corresponding levels of uncertainty, (b) quantifying the degree of confidence
  associated with a given diagnostic, and (c) dealing with the missing values that
  typically plague medical data. We quantify the potential of this approach on simulated
  data, and showcase its practicality by deploying it on a real COVID19 immunity study.'
