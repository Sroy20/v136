title: Neural Temporal Point Processes For Modelling Electronic Health Records
abstract: The modelling of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) has the potential to drive
  more efficient allocation of healthcare resources, enabling early intervention strategies
  and advancing personalised healthcare. However, EHRs are challenging to model due
  to their realisation as noisy, multi-modal data occurring at irregular time intervals.
  To address their temporal nature, we treat EHRs as samples generated by a Temporal
  Point Process (TPP), enabling us to model what happened in an event with when it
  happened in a principled way. We gather and propose neural network parameterisations
  of TPPs, collectively referred to as Neural TPPs. We perform evaluations on synthetic
  EHRs as well as on a set of established benchmarks. We show that TPPs significantly
  outperform their non-TPP counterparts on EHRs. We also show that an assumption of
  many Neural TPPs, that the class distribution is conditionally independent of time,
  reduces performance on EHRs. Finally, our proposed attention-based Neural TPP performs
  favourably compared to existing models, whilst aligning with real world interpretability
  requirements, an important step towards a component of clinical decision support
  systems.
