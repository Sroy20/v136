title: Parkinsonian Chinese Speech Analysis towards Automatic Classification of Parkinson’s
  Disease
abstract: Speech disorders often occur at the early stage of Parkinson’s disease (PD).
  The speech impairments could be indicators of the disorder for early diagnosis,
  while motor symptoms are not obvious. In this study, we constructed a new speech
  corpus of Mandarin Chinese and addressed classification of patients with PD. We
  implemented classical machine learning methods with ranking algorithms for feature
  selection, convolutional and recurrent deep networks, and an end to end system.
  Our classification accuracy significantly surpassed state-of-the-art studies. The
  result suggests that free talk has stronger classification power than standard speech
  tasks, which could help the design of future speech tasks for efficient early diagnosis
  of the disease. Based on existing classification methods and our natural speech
  study, the automatic detection of PD from daily conversation could be accessible
  to the majority of the clinical population.
