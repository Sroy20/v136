title: sEMG Gesture Recognition with a Simple Model of Attention
abstract: Myoelectric control is one of the leading areas of research in the field
  of robotic prosthetics. We present our research in surface electromyography (sEMG)
  signal classification, where our simple and novel attention-based approach now leads
  the industry, universally beating more complex, state-ofthe-art models. Our novel
  attention-based model achieves benchmark leading results on multiple industry-standard
  datasets including 53 finger, wrist, and grasping motions, improving over both sophisticated
  signal processing and CNN-based approaches. Our strong results with a straightforward
  model also indicate that sEMG represents a promising avenue for future machine learning
  research, with applications not only in prosthetics, but also in other important
  areas, such as diagnosis and prognostication of neurodegenerative diseases, computationally
  mediated surgeries, and advanced robotic control. We reinforce this suggestion with
  extensive ablative studies, demonstrating that a neural network can easily extract
  higher order spatiotemporal features from noisy sEMG data collected by affordable,
  consumer-grade sensors.
