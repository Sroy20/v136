title: An Empirical Study of Representation Learning for Reinforcement Learning in
  Healthcare
abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has recently been applied to sequential estimation
  and prediction problems identifying and developing hypothetical treatment strategies
  for septic patients, with a particular focus on offline learning with observational
  data. In practice, successful RL relies on informative latent states derived from
  sequential observations to develop optimal treatment strategies. To date, how best
  to construct such states in a healthcare setting is an open question. In this paper,
  we perform an empirical study of several information encoding architectures using
  data from septic patients in the MIMIC-III dataset to form representations of a
  patient state. We evaluate the impact of representation dimension, correlations
  with established acuity scores, and the treatment policies derived from them. We
  find that sequentially formed state representations facilitate effective policy
  learning in batch settings, validating a more thoughtful approach to representation
  learning that remains faithful to the sequential and partial nature of healthcare
  data.
