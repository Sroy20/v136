title: Improved Clinical Abbreviation Expansion via Non-Sense-Based Approaches
abstract: 'Abbreviation expansion is an important problem in clinical natural language
  processing because abbreviations often occur in text notes in medical records, and
  expansions of these abbreviations are critical for downstream applications such
  as assistive diagnosis and insurance code review. Previous studies have treated
  abbreviation expansion as a special case of word sense disambiguation; however,
  abbreviation expansion is easier because we only need the character level expansion
  and not necessarily the full sense of the abbreviation. In particular, such character
  level expansions may naturally occur elsewhere in medical contexts. Accordingly,
  we consider two categories of methods for abbreviation expansion: (a) non-sense-based
  methods that use information solely at lexical levels using state-of-the-art language
  models, and (b) sense-based methods that also incorporate sense information, such
  as glosses, from knowledge bases, to simultaneously perform the two tasks of expansion
  and disambiguation of the abbreviation. We propose two language model based approaches,
  including a novel length-agnostic permutation language model, find non-sense methods
  to be more effective than sense-based methods, and achieve the state-of-theart on
  three clinical datasets.'
