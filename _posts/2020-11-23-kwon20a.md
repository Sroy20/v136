title: Appropriate Evaluation of Diagnostic Utility of Machine Learning Algorithm
  Generated Images
abstract: Generative machine learning (ML) methods can reduce time, cost, and radiation
  associated with medical image acquisition, compression, or generation techniques.
  While quantitative metrics are commonly used in the evaluation of ML generated images,
  it is unknown how well these quantitative metrics relate to the diagnostic utility
  of images. Here, fellowship-trained radiologists provided diagnoses and qualitative
  evaluations on chest radiographs reconstructed from the current standard JPEG2000
  or variational autoencoder (VAE) techniques. Cohen’s kappa coefficient measured
  the agreement of diagnoses based on different reconstructions. Methods that produced
  similar Fréchet inception distance (FID) showed similar diagnostic performances.
  Thus in place of time-intensive expert radiologist verification, an appropriate
  target FID – an objective quantitative metric – can evaluate the clinical utility
  of ML generated medical images.
