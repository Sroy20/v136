title: 'DeepHeartBeat: Latent trajectory learning of cardiac cycles using cardiac
  ultrasounds'
abstract: Echocardiography monitors the heart movement for noninvasive diagnosis of
  heart diseases. It proves to be of profound practical importance as it combines
  low-cost portable instrumentation and rapid image acquisition without the risks
  of ionizing radiation. However, echocardiograms produce high-dimensional, noisy
  data which frequently proved difficult to interpret. As a solution, we propose a
  novel autoencoder-based framework, DeepHeartBeat, to learn human interpretable representations
  of cardiac cycles from cardiac ultrasound data. Our model encodes high dimensional
  observations by a cyclic trajectory in a lower dimensional space. We show that the
  learned parameters describing the latent trajectory are well interpretable and we
  demonstrate the versatility of our model by successfully applying it to various
  cardiologically relevant tasks, such as ejection fraction prediction and arrhythmia
  detection. As a result, DeepHeartBeat promises to serve as a valuable assistant
  tool for automating therapy decisions and guiding clinical care.
