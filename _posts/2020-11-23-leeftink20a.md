title: 'Spectral discontinuity design: Interrupted time series with spectral mixture
  kernels'
abstract: Quasi-experimental designs allow researchers to determine the effect of
  a treatment, even when randomized controlled trials are infeasible. A prominent
  example is interrupted time series (ITS) design, in which the effect of an intervention
  is determined by comparing the extrapolation of a model trained on data acquired
  up to moment of intervention, with the interpolation by a model trained on data
  up to the intervention. Typical approaches for ITS use (segmented) linear regression,
  and consequently ignore many of the spectral features of time series data. In this
  paper, we propose a Bayesian nonparametric approach to ITS, that uses Gaussian process
  regression and the spectral mixture kernel. This approach can capture more structure
  of the time series than traditional methods like linear regression or AR(I)MA models,
  which improves the extrapolation performance, and hence the accuracy of causal inference.
  We demonstrate our approach in simulations, and use it to determine the causal effect
  of Kundalini yoga meditation on heart rate oscillations. We show that our approach
  is able to detect the causal effect of interventions that alter the spectral features
  of these time series.
