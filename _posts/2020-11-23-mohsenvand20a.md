title: Contrastive Representation Learning for Electroencephalogram Classification
abstract: 'Interpreting and labeling human electroencephalogram (EEG) is a challenging
  task requiring years of medical training. We present a framework for learning representations
  from EEG signals via contrastive learning. By recombining channels from multi-channel
  recordings, we increase the number of samples quadratically per recording. We train
  a channel-wise feature extractor by extending the SimCLR framework to time-series
  data. We introduce a set of augmentations for EEG and study their efficacy on different
  classification tasks. We demonstrate that the learned features improve EEG classification
  and significantly reduce the amount of labeled data needed on three separate tasks:
  (1) Emotion Recognition (SEED), (2) Normal/Abnormal EEG classification (TUH), and
  (3) Sleep-stage scoring (SleepEDF). Our models show improved performance over previously
  reported supervised models on SEED and SleepEDF and self-supervised models on all
  three tasks.'
