title: A Neural SIR Model for Global Forecasting
abstract: Being able to understand and forecast epidemic developments is crucial for
  policymakers. We develop a predictive model combining epidemiological dynamics of
  compartmental models with highly non-linear interactions learned by a LSTM Network.
  A novel dynamic SIR model is fit to variables related to the population transmission
  of Covid-19. This is embedded in a Bayesian recursive updating framework which is
  then coupled with a LSTM network to forecast cases of Covid-19. The model significantly
  improves forecasts over simple univariate LSTM or SIR models. We apply the model
  to developed and developing countries and forecast confirmed infections and analyze
  future trajectories.
