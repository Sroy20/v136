title: 'Attend and Decode: 4D fMRI Task State Decoding Using Attention Models'
abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a neuroimaging modality
  that captures the blood oxygen level in a subject’s brain while the subject either
  rests or performs a variety of functional tasks under different conditions. Given
  fMRI data, the problem of inferring the task, known as task state decoding, is challenging
  due to the high dimensionality (hundreds of million sampling points per datum) and
  complex spatio-temporal blood flow patterns inherent in the data. In this work,
  we propose to tackle the fMRI task state decoding problem by casting it as a 4D
  spatio-temporal classification problem. We present a novel architecture called Brain
  Attend and Decode (BAnD), that uses residual convolutional neural networks for spatial
  feature extraction and self-attention mechanisms for temporal modeling. We achieve
  significant performance gain compared to previous works on a 7-task benchmark from
  the large-scale Human Connectome Project-Young Adult (HCP-YA) dataset. We also investigate
  the transferability of BAnD’s extracted features on unseen HCP tasks, either by
  freezing the spatial feature extraction layers and retraining the temporal model,
  or finetuning the entire model. The pretrained features from BAnD are useful on
  similar tasks while finetuning them yields competitive results on unseen tasks/conditions.
