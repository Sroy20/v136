title: 'ML4H Auditing: From Paper to Practice'
abstract: 'Healthcare systems are currently adapting to digital technologies, producing
  large quantities of novel data. Based on these data, machine-learning algorithms
  have been developed to support practitioners in labor-intensive workflows such as
  diagnosis, prognosis, triage or treatment of disease. However, their translation
  into medical practice is often hampered by a lack of careful evaluation in different
  settings. Efforts have started worldwide to establish guidelines for evaluating
  machine learning for health (ML4H) tools, highlighting the necessity to evaluate
  models for bias, interpretability, robustness, and possible failure modes. However,
  testing and adopting these guidelines in practice remains an open challenge. In
  this work, we target the paper-to-practice gap by applying an ML4H audit framework
  proposed by the ITU/WHO Focus Group on Artificial Intelligence for Health (FG-AI4H)
  to three use cases: diagnostic prediction of diabetic retinopathy, diagnostic prediction
  of Alzheimer’s disease, and cytomorphologic classification for leukemia diagnostics.
  The assessment comprises dimensions such as bias, interpretability, and robustness.
  Our results highlight the importance of fine-grained and caseadapted quality assessment,
  provide support for incorporating proposed quality assessment considerations of
  ML4H during the entire development life cycle, and suggest improvements for future
  ML4H reference evaluation frameworks.'
