title: 'CheXphoto: 10,000+ Photos and Transformations of Chest X-rays for Benchmarking
  Deep Learning Robustness'
abstract: Clinical deployment of deep learning algorithms for chest x-ray interpretation
  requires a solution that can integrate into the vast spectrum of clinical workflows
  across the world. An appealing approach to scaled deployment is to leverage the
  ubiquity of smartphones by capturing photos of x-rays to share with clinicians using
  messaging services like WhatsApp. However, the application of chest x-ray algorithms
  to photos of chest x-rays requires reliable classification in the presence of artifacts
  not typically encountered in digital x-rays used to train machine learning models.
  We introduce CheXphoto, a dataset of smartphone photos and synthetic photographic
  transformations of chest x-rays sampled from the CheXpert dataset. To generate CheXphoto
  we (1) automatically and manually captured photos of digital x-rays under different
  settings, and (2) generated synthetic transformations of digital x-rays targeted
  to make them look like photos of digital x-rays and x-ray films. We release this
  dataset as a resource for testing and improving the robustness of deep learning
  algorithms for automated chest x-ray interpretation on smartphone photos of chest
  x-rays.
