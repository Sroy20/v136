title: 'Trust Issues: Uncertainty Estimation Does Not Enable Reliable OOD Detection
  On Medical Tabular Data'
abstract: When deploying machine learning models in high-stakes real-world environments
  such as health care, it is crucial to accurately assess the uncertainty concerning
  a model’s prediction on abnormal inputs. However, there is a scarcity of literature
  analyzing this problem on medical data, especially on mixed-type tabular data such
  as Electronic Health Records. We close this gap by presenting a series of tests
  including a large variety of contemporary uncertainty estimation techniques, in
  order to determine whether they are able to identify out-ofdistribution (OOD) patients.
  In contrast to previous work, we design tests on realistic and clinically relevant
  OOD groups, and run experiments on real-world medical data. We find that almost
  all techniques fail to achieve convincing results, partly disagreeing with earlier
  findings.
