title: 'EEG-GCNN: Augmenting Electroencephalogram-based Neurological Disease Diagnosis
  using a Domain-guided Graph Convolutional Neural Network'
abstract: 'This paper presents a novel graph convolutional neural network (GCNN)-based
  approach for improving the diagnosis of neurological diseases using scalp-electroencephalograms
  (EEGs). Although EEG is one of the main tests used for neurological-disease diagnosis,
  the sensitivity of EEG-based expert visual diagnosis remains at ∼50%. This indicates
  a clear need for advanced methodology to reduce the false negative rate in detecting
  abnormal scalp-EEGs. In that context, we focus on the problem of distinguishing
  the abnormal scalp EEGs of patients with neurological diseases, which were originally
  classified as ‘normal’ by experts, from the scalp EEGs of healthy individuals. The
  contributions of this paper are three-fold: 1) we present EEG-GCNN, a novel GCNN
  model for EEG data that captures both the spatial and functional connectivity between
  the scalp electrodes, 2) using EEG-GCNN, we perform the first large-scale evaluation
  of the aforementioned hypothesis, and 3) using two large scalp-EEG databases, we
  demonstrate that EEG-GCNN significantly outperforms the human baseline and classical
  machine learning (ML) baselines, with an AUC of 0.90.'
