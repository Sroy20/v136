title: Confounding Feature Acquisition for Causal Effect Estimation
abstract: Reliable treatment effect estimation from observational data depends on
  the availability of all confounding information. While much work has targeted treatment
  effect estimation from observational data, there is relatively little work in the
  setting of confounding variable missingness, where collecting more information on
  confounders is often costly or time-consuming. In this work, we frame this challenge
  as a problem of feature acquisition of confounding features for causal inference.
  Our goal is to prioritize acquiring values for a fixed and known subset of missing
  confounders in samples that lead to efficient average treatment effect estimation.
  We propose two acquisition strategies based on i) covariate balancing (CB), and
  ii) reducing statistical estimation error on observed factual outcome error (OE).
  We compare CB and OE on five common causal effect estimation methods, and demonstrate
  improved sample efficiency of OE over baseline methods under various settings. We
  also provide visualizations for further analysis on the difference between our proposed
  methods.
