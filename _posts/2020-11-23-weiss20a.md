title: 'TL-Lite: Temporal Visualization and Learning for Clinical Forecasting'
abstract: 'Clinical data extraction is a necessary step for quantitative analysis
  in clinical research. Whereas most machine learning algorithms learn from fixed
  length or regularly-collected panel data, health records data are neither. To facilitate
  the development of transparent and reproducible machine learning models from such
  data, we introduce TL-Lite, a clinical data ingestion, transformation, and visualization
  tool for conducting temporal machine learning. The central principle behind TL-Lite
  is to provide visual responsiveness at the individual level alongside management
  of the desired transformations behind the scenes that go on to be applied throughout
  the cohort and that result in cohort-level summaries, statistics, models and predictions.
  Characterization of the tool, discussion of design choices, and examples of use
  demonstrate its added value. A demo is provided at \url{https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/jweiss2/viz.html}. '
