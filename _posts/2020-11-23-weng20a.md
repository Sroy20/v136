title: Addressing the Real-world Class Imbalance Problem in Dermatology
abstract: 'Class imbalance is a common problem in medical diagnosis, causing a standard
  classifier to be biased towards the common classes and perform poorly on the rare
  classes. This is especially true for dermatology, a specialty with thousands of
  skin conditions but many of which have low prevalence in the real world. Motivated
  by recent advances, we explore few-shot learning methods as well as conventional
  class imbalance techniques for the skin condition recognition problem and propose
  an evaluation setup to fairly assess the real-world utility of such approaches.
  We find the performance of few-show learning methods does not reach that of conventional
  class imbalance techniques, but combining the two approaches using a novel ensemble
  improves model performance, especially for rare classes. We conclude that ensembling
  can be useful to address the class imbalance problem, yet progress can further be
  accelerated by real-world evaluation setups for benchmarking new methods. '
